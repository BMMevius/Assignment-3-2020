# Introduction

This is the template repository for the third assignment of Software Evolution 2019-2020. 
This repo contains the dataset on which you should run your statistical analysis, and
this readme contains the list of requirements your repository should satisfy. 

# Dataset

The dataset is available in the `./data` directory of the repository. Each file is compressed
as a `.gz` file (use 7Zip on Windows to expand). This is due to the fact that GitHub
imposes size restrictions on the size of individual files. Documentation on each of the
individual files can be found here:
